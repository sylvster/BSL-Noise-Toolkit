  DESCRIPTION:
 
     This package contains a series of Python 3 scripts to:
        - read waveforms for given network/station/location/channels from local files
        - request/read waveforms for given network/station/location/channels using the obspy FDSN client
        - compute and populate an hourly "PSD database"
        - extract PSDs and PDFs from the "PSD database"
 
 
  INSTALLATION:
 
     see INSTALL.txt

  RUNNING THE SCRIPTS:

  HISTORY

      - 2021-08-31 v.2.1.0: This patch addresses the output file naming issue when data were read from files.
                            The bug was causing output to be written under the same file name. This patch also adds the
                            script version to the log file.
      - 2021-06-23 v.2.0.1: Fixed the issue with processing beyond requested time window when multiple local
                            files exist.
      - 2020-11-16 v.2.0.0: Python 3, use of Fedcatalog, adoption of CSD changes and adoption of PEP 8 style guide.
      - 2019-09-09 Robert Anthony (USGS, Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory):
                            Using CSD to compute the cross spectral density of two signals
      - 2017-01-18 v.0.9.5: support for reading data and metadata from files only with no Internet requirement
      - 2016-11-01 v.0.9.0: added support for obtaining channel responses from local station XML response files by
                            introducing the following two functions in tsLIB.py:
                            getResponseInventory - to build a list of response inventories under a given met directory
                            getResponseFromFile - to find response for a given Network, Station, Location and channel
                            added respDirectory to common.py parameter file to disable looking for response files on
                            local drives, set this parameter to None. Otherwise, set it to the response directory path
      - 2016-01-25 v.0.8.2: added polarization parameters to common.par and also made changes to some libraries in
                            support of the polarization bundle added user and password parameters to common.par and
                            ntk_computePSD.py in support of restricted data access
      - 2015-04-30 v.0.8.1: added powerDirectory and imageDirectory parameters to common.par in support of ME bundle.
      - 2015-04-07 v.0.8.0: now produces clear messages for missing parameters in the parameter file. Addresses reported
                            maximum period values. Minor bugs and enhancements
      - 2015-02-24 v.0.7.0: introduced two new parameters (performInstrumentCorrection, applyScale) to allow user avoid
                            instrument correction also now user can turn od decon. filter
      - 2014-11-24 v.0.6.2: documentation update and expansion of the common.py file to support Microseism Energy bundle
      - 2014-10-16 v.0.6.0: ntk_extractPsdHour.py output file name now includes the x-axis type
      - 2014-10-01 v.0.5.0: initial Beta release. Made the smoothing configurable, reorganized parameters for easier
                            maintenance
      - 2014-05-20 modified the output format to:
         1. compute hourly PSDs and store them under the psdDb directory (this will be similar to PQLXâ€™s database) as
            basis for script outputs
         2. provide the extractPsdHourly.py script to extract PSD's for a given channel and bounding parameters.
            The output is similar to PQLX's exPSDhour script
         3. provide the extractPdf.py that will extract PSDs to create (hourly and daily)  PDFs for a given channel
            and bounding parameters. The output is similar to the current PDF output from the PDF-PSD data product
            (http://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/pdf-psd/)

            Users should be able to use the above outputs with their existing scripts that work with the PQLX and
            Quack outputs (hourly bin files have hour-minute as the first column to avoid cross-reference to hour.bin
            file of Quack

      - 2014-03-19: Added data file input option
      - 2014-03-07: Initial Alpha release
